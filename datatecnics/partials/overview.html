        <strong>System 10</strong>
        will transform the nature of our relationship with water, turning recycling from not just an environmental concern, but also into the right commercial
        decision with built-in IIOT technology. <strong>CIPPS&trade; WX100</strong> and <strong>CIPPS&trade; EX100</strong> will convert standard metal pipes into intelligent
        pieces of technology, capable of communicating their physical condition in real-time, providing precise data with the predictive ability to pinpoint
        precision. This can only happen through IIOT, through ground-breaking advances, to create a world where we can truly have critical infrastructure, powered
        and protected by intelligent Datatecnics technology.
